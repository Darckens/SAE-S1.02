# SAE-S1.02 Reading and Writing Data Files  

## General Context  

As part of our first-year B.U.T. Data Science program, our team of three students spent a full day (from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM) coding a Python program to read, process, and analyze text files.  

The objective was to extract and structure customer information from provided files to generate useful statistics. This project allowed us to apply our skills in file manipulation, task automation, and data analysis—key competencies in data science.  

## Objectives and Problem Statement  

Today, data exists in a wide variety of formats. In any data exploitation project, it is crucial to integrate and make data accessible so that it can be used efficiently.  

As part of this SAE, we worked on data migration and transformation, simulating the role of a data integration consultant. Our goal was to convert text files extracted from a source system to meet the requirements of a target system.  

### The objectives of this SAE are as follows:  

- Understand the importance of adhering to technical specifications to ensure interoperability with an existing program.  
- Design and develop a Python program capable of reading, transforming, and writing data while complying with these specifications.  

## Project Description  

We were tasked with designing and developing a program to process a data stream (reading, transformation, writing) while meeting well-defined requirements.  

The project was carried out in several stages:  

1. **Analyzing the specifications** to understand the format of the source files and the expected format.  
2. **Developing scripts** necessary for data transformation.  
3. **Verifying the consistency** of the obtained results.  
4. **Documenting the code** to ensure clarity and reusability of the program.  

Thanks to this SAE, we strengthened our skills in file manipulation, data processing, and structured development—key skills in Data Science.
